- **[Tag Based](Tag_Based/Collection.md)** - Suitable for general diffusion-based models

## 🎯 How to Use These Prompts

When using the prompts in this collection, pay attention to whether a **character reference image** is required:

- **🔴 Requires Reference Image** - These prompts are designed to work with a character reference image that you provide. The prompt will transform, pose, or apply effects to your existing character design.

- **🟢 Standalone Prompt** - These prompts work independently without requiring a character reference image. The AI will generate the entire scene and character from the prompt description alone.

Each case in the collections is labeled with one of these indicators to help you choose the right prompt for your needs.
