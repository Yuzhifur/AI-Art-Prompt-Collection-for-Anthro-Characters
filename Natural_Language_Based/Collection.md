**Prompt**

```
Create a four-step transformation chart showing how the same character evolves from a quadrupedal fluffy creature into a human boy with furry ears.  
Make each step aligned from left to right. Space the four steps tightly rather than loosely, design certain overlapping between them.
Arrange the four figures be front facing, but with different tilts to the left or right, avoid having them all tilted to left or right. For example: [right, left, right, left]
Add a long horizontal arrow at the bottom with tick marks labeled 1, 2, 3, 4 as the legend.  

Include a hanging bookmark tag in the top-left corner with a hand-drawn look, slightly bent, and write in cute handwritten lettering:
"Yuzhi's mofu mofu transformation"
Add a small decorative feather or doodle beside the text.

Step 1:
A fluffy chibi qilin creature walking on all fours. Tiny arms and tiny legs, very round body, no clothing.  
Keep all the essential character traits such as ears and hairstyle.  
Facing the camera with a playful wink expression.  
Very small and low to the ground.

Step 2:
A slightly taller small furry creature. It stands upright on two legs but still has short bendy legs and short chubby arms, retaining a cute compact shape.  
He starts wearing a single piece of clothing on the upper body, but no pants.  
A soft woven toy camera hangs from his chest, but he is not holding it.  
Still fluffy all over.  
Height is slightly taller than Step 1.

Step 3:
A straight-leg furry boy standing upright on fully human-like straight legs, but still furry all over.  
Hands and feet remain paws.  
He now wears both a top and pants.  
A card-type camera hangs from his chest, but he is not holding it.  
He is clearly taller than in Step 2.  
He shows a happy, energetic pose and expression.

Step 4:
A human boy with large furry ears.  
Completely human body and skin except for the ears. No tail.  
Soft light skin tone.  
Fluffy light sky-blue hair with pastel tones, slightly tousled and cute.  
Large gold bright eyes and an adorable youth style. 
Two wooden horns, with a leaf on one horn, are still present.
He uses one hand to show off a tripod, supporting an intricate and large camera system with an 800mm lens.
He uses another hand to set off a camera drone, which the camera drone has just started and is rising.
He looks into the viewer and smile happily.
Wearing the same clothing, with more intricate decorations and gadgets added to the clothes, including a white and blue belt bag, cute sprinkling whale attached to waist, and a cute little qilin plushie that sits on shoulder.
He is the tallest of all four steps.

---

Soft pastel color palette.  
Cute Japanese-style youthful illustration.  
Clean thin line art, round shapes, and bright expressive eyes.  
Soft lighting with gentle shadows.  
Add small doodle accents such as sparkles, tiny marks, and simple motion lines near the characters.  
Overall warm, fluffy, charming mood with very light textures that resemble soft paper.  
Keep all four steps visually consistent as one character family, matching proportions and hair silhouette.

**Prompt**

```
Generate a screenshot from a galgame presented in a cozy, misty night hotspring setting, with the character to interact with be the one provided in the image. The environment is well litted. The character is in the hotspring, sitting closely right in front of the camera, with only the upper half body seen above water. The character is facing towards the camera with a shy expression. The character's (taken off) clothes can be seen behind in the near background. At the very top of the screen is a horizontal relationship/status bar with a heart-themed icon on one side.
Surrounding the character is an array of pixel-art interaction icons. To the left are several interaction buttons arranged vertically and diagonally, including four interacting and touching options. To the right is another cluster of UI icons featuring options for dialogue, affection, item use, and posture changes.
Along the bottom left is a grid of eight selectable body-area icons, each paired with small multi-slot progress indicators beneath them. On the bottom right is a compact status panel showing two separate lines of information: one represents a desire or arousal index, and the other conveys the character's current emotional state.
Across the very bottom of the screen is a dialogue box with rounded corners, containing a line of text spoken by the character: "[なぜだか、さっきあんな風に触られたのがすごく気持ちよかった.]". Write all text in japanese.

**Prompt**

```
Generate a half body (can only see head ,paws, collar, and part of shoulder) of cute chibi emoji art of this character saying "杂鱼, 杂鱼".

Slightly teasing expression. Eyelids are half-closed, with the brows relaxed into a lazy arc. There's a flushed blush on the cheeks, and the open mouth is curved into a playful, taunting laugh.

Hand Position:
One hand is lifted near the mouth, covering it partially in a coy, "hehe-I-know-something" gesture. The fingers are curved inward softly, as if the character is giggling behind their hand.

Cute Japanese-style youthful illustration.
