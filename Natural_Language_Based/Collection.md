**Prompt**

```
Create a four-step transformation chart showing how the same character evolves from a quadrupedal fluffy creature into a human boy with furry ears.  
Make each step aligned from left to right. Space the four steps tightly rather than loosely, design certain overlapping between them.
Arrange the four figures be front facing, but with different tilts to the left or right, avoid having them all tilted to left or right. For example: [right, left, right, left]
Add a long horizontal arrow at the bottom with tick marks labeled 1, 2, 3, 4 as the legend.  

Include a hanging bookmark tag in the top-left corner with a hand-drawn look, slightly bent, and write in cute handwritten lettering:
"<character_name>'s mofu mofu transformation"
Add a small decorative feather or doodle beside the text.

Step 1:
A fluffy chibi qilin creature walking on all fours. Tiny arms and tiny legs, very round body, no clothing.  
Keep all the essential character traits such as ears and hairstyle.  
Facing the camera with a playful wink expression.  
Very small and low to the ground.

Step 2:
A slightly taller small furry creature. It stands upright on two legs but still has short bendy legs and short chubby arms, retaining a cute compact shape.  
He starts wearing a single piece of clothing on the upper body, but no pants.  
A soft woven toy camera hangs from his chest, but he is not holding it.  
Still fluffy all over.  
Height is slightly taller than Step 1.

Step 3:
A straight-leg furry boy standing upright on fully human-like straight legs, but still furry all over.  
Hands and feet remain paws.  
He now wears both a top and pants.  
A card-type camera hangs from his chest, but he is not holding it.  
He is clearly taller than in Step 2.  
He shows a happy, energetic pose and expression.

Step 4:
A human boy with large furry ears.  
Completely human body and skin except for the ears. No tail.  
Soft light skin tone.  
Fluffy light hair with pastel tones, slightly tousled and cute.  
Large gold bright eyes and an adorable youth style. 
Two wooden horns, with a leaf on one horn, are still present.
He uses one hand to show off a tripod, supporting an intricate and large camera system with an 800mm lens.
He uses another hand to set off a camera drone, which the camera drone has just started and is rising.
He looks into the viewer and smile happily.
Wearing the same clothing, with more intricate decorations and gadgets added to the clothes, including a white and blue belt bag, cute sprinkling whale attached to waist, and a cute little qilin plushie that sits on shoulder.
He is the tallest of all four steps.

---

Soft pastel color palette.  
Cute Japanese-style youthful illustration.  
Clean thin line art, round shapes, and bright expressive eyes.  
Soft lighting with gentle shadows.  
Add small doodle accents such as sparkles, tiny marks, and simple motion lines near the characters.  
Overall warm, fluffy, charming mood with very light textures that resemble soft paper.  
Keep all four steps visually consistent as one character family, matching proportions and hair silhouette.

```
Generate a screenshot from a galgame presented in a cozy, misty night hotspring setting, with the character to interact with be the one provided in the image. The environment is well litted. The character is in the hotspring, sitting closely right in front of the camera, with only the upper half body seen above water. The character is facing towards the camera with a shy expression. The character's (taken off) clothes can be seen behind in the near background. At the very top of the screen is a horizontal relationship/status bar with a heart-themed icon on one side.
Surrounding the character is an array of pixel-art interaction icons. To the left are several interaction buttons arranged vertically and diagonally, including four interacting and touching options. To the right is another cluster of UI icons featuring options for dialogue, affection, item use, and posture changes.
Along the bottom left is a grid of eight selectable body-area icons, each paired with small multi-slot progress indicators beneath them. On the bottom right is a compact status panel showing two separate lines of information: one represents a desire or arousal index, and the other conveys the character's current emotional state.
Across the very bottom of the screen is a dialogue box with rounded corners, containing a line of text spoken by the character: "[なぜだか、さっきあんな風に触られたのがすごく気持ちよかった.]". Write all text in japanese.

### No. 9: Pastel Chibi Self-Kiss Scene 🔴

<img src="assets/9/image.png" width="300" alt=""><br>
<sub>Credit: [与纸Yuzhi](https://github.com/Yuzhifur)</sub>


**Prompt**

```
Generate an art of the furry boy in the provided image kissing a duplicate of himself.
Here are the pose and style requirements:
A dynamic composition where both figures are extremely closed up, with one figure kneels while the other stands, their faces meeting at an angle where their lips have just separated. A thin, glistening strand of saliva connects them in the frozen instant. Their expressions burst with playful intensity: the kneeling figure looking up with a satisfied smile and half-closed eyes, the standing figure gazing downward with a blush and shyness, breathless softness. The kneeling figure has one hand resting on the standing figure's hip, the other lightly brushing against the standing figure's forearm. The standing figure's hands float mid-air, one reaching as if about to cradle the kneeling figure's cheek. The pose is full of motion even in stillness.
A playful, pastel-colored illustration drawn with a soft, cartoony aesthetic. The lineart is clean, slightly thick, and uniformly smooth. Colors consist of gentle pastels: clean whites, cool greens, dusty purples, soft yellows, and muted browns. Shading is minimal, using flat tones with very light, subtle shadows. Highlights are sparse or stylized rather than realistic. The characters have simplified, expressive faces with exaggerated eyes and small mouths, giving a cute, humorous tone. Anatomy is intentionally stylized, with round heads, compact bodies, and chibi-like proportions. Fur is indicated using simple zigzag or tuft shapes rather than detailed texture.
The background features a grid pattern drawn with thin, light lines, giving a notebook or sketchpad aesthetic. Over the grid, there are playful doodles scattered around: paw prints, stars, random scribbles, abstract swirls, and tiny icons that add energy without clutter. A large rectangular section of solid pastel yellow occupies the top and bottom of the canvas, creating a banded layout that frames the characters. The overall composition feels like a character sheet or playful catalog page. Text labels in a loose, handwritten font appear near each character, adding a casual, illustrative charm. The entire piece has an energetic, whimsical mood, cohesive color harmony, and a soft, friendly visual atmosphere.

```
Create a "Front 3/4 and Back 3/4" reference illustration of the character provided in the image. Follow these guidelines:
# The Neutral Front Three-Quarter View (placed on the left):
* Viewpoint: full-body front three-quarter angle; the body is angled about 20–30° so both the chest and part of the side are visible.
* Overall posture: a neutral, calm slow-walk posture. The spine is straight and level, head held naturally raised.
* Head: facing directly toward the viewer despite the body being angled; facial direction is centered, not turned.
* Front legs: positioned in a natural slow-walk stance. One front leg is slightly ahead of the other, but both remain relaxed with paws resting flat on the ground. No stiff soldier stance.
* Hind legs: also in slow-walk alignment, with one hind leg slightly behind the other. The toes touch the ground naturally, no splay.
* Paws: fingers relaxed, no gripping or tension.
* Tail: neutral, gently lowered or softly flowing behind in a resting alignment, not curled or expressive.
* Expression: neutral and calm.
* Placement: left side of the illustration.
# The Neutral Back Three-Quarter View (placed on the right):
* Viewpoint: full-body back three-quarter angle; the back and hips are the primary view, with a portion of the side and shoulder visible.
* Overall posture: same neutral slow-walk continuity as the front view, as if the feral moment is frozen mid-step.
* Head: turned slightly toward the viewer so part of the face is visible, but still clearly oriented from behind.
* Front legs: natural slow-walk placement visible from the back angle, with paws angled outward slightly as real quadrupeds do. No parallel columns.
* Hind legs: one slightly forward, one slightly behind, with hocks and paws visible clearly from behind. Keep grounded and relaxed.
* Tail: relaxed, resting along the natural curve of the spine; visible but not expressive.
* Expression: neutral and calm.
* Placement: right side of the illustration.
# Central Paw Reference (placed between the two views):
* Two disembodied front paws (up to the wrist only) shown as a pair.
* Orientation: facing the viewer directly and symmetrically.
* Paw beans: clearly visible and centered; fingers gently spread, relaxed, with no exaggerated curvature.
# General requirements:
* White background. No labels, text, icons, watermarks, props, objects, or environmental elements.
* Mostly symmetrical for left and right due to both being three-quarter tilt. Differ in details.
* Keep character details and style true to original
* Keep scale consistent across all three components.

### No. 15: Visual Novel Screenshot - Shoe POV Sequence 🔴

<img src="assets/15/image.png" width="300" alt=""><br>
<sub>Credit: Original Inspiration from 云阁, prompt devised by [与纸Yuzhi](https://github.com/Yuzhifur)</sub>


**Prompt**

```
Create a single high-resolution vertical composite made of two sequential visual-novel style screenshots stacked one above the other, each framed inside a white desktop application window (Windows-like title bar with tiny minimize/close icons, the Chinese window title '家有兽人' visible in the top-left of each window). Keep the two windows centered, separated by a thin gap, and show subtle drop shadows so they read as separate windows on the same canvas.

---

# TOP SCREENSHOT (upper window)

Camera & perspective: The camera is placed inside one of the character's sports shoes, pointing upward through the shoe opening toward the sky. It reads as a true interior POV: you can see the textured shoe lining and circular rim framing the shot. The nearest object is the character's paw moving down into the shoe — enormous and heavily foreshortened by the extreme close-up, pads and small dirt smudges visible in stark detail. The rest of the limb and body tower above the lens and sit slightly out of focus because of the very shallow depth of field; daylight from above backlights the edges, creating a bright rim and soft highlights on fur/fabric while the far background (blue sky and clouds) stays crisp but secondary. This is literally the instant before the character slides the paw into the shoe.

Foreground object: the character's raised foot is pushed close to the lens, almost filling the frame. The sole is muddy and textured, visible dirt smudges and creases; the toes/pads read as close, tactile forms. Surrounding the circular frame is textured fabric rim (like the inside of a shoe or tunnel) with visible weave and soft shadows.

Midground/background: the rest of the character is standing above, slightly out of focus due to shallow depth of field. A bright blue sky with soft white clouds provides a clean background. Warm rim light and daylight soft shadows.

UI/overlays: a semi-transparent black dialogue box runs across the bottom of this window. On the left of the dialogue box is a small chibi-style portrait of the character and a blue name label. There are two dialogue choice lines displayed inside the box; one of the choices is highlighted. All text is in Chinese (render realistic Chinese characters). Keep the textbox style typical of modern VN: subtle inner glow, thin border, and a faint downward chevron indicating more text.

# LOWER SCREENSHOT (lower window)

Camera & perspective: medium three-quarter view (about knee-to-head framing) at eye level relative to the seated character on a running track. Slight telephoto compression so the background stadium bleachers and field feel slightly compressed.

Pose & action: the character is seated on the outer lane of a running track, one leg extended forward with the shoe partially removed; the character is holding the shoe and looking down at their foot/shoe with a surprised/confused expression. The shoe (foreground) shows a dirt-streaked sole and sits partly facing the viewer.

Environment: an outdoor school stadium scene — red running track lanes, green field, distant bleachers, trees and low buildings under a clear sky. A few other furry boys are visible jogging along the track in the background. Late-afternoon warm sunlight produces long soft shadows and mild lens flare/bloom near the top-left, creating a gentle golden rim on the character and shoe.

UI/overlays: another semi-transparent black dialogue box overlays the bottom of this window with the same chibi portrait and name label at its left. In the top-right corner of this lower window, show a small in-game achievement banner in Chinese displaying the ending name '无情的脏爪'. Keep the window chrome consistent with the top screenshot.

---

# ART STYLE & RENDERING

Overall style: high-quality anime / stylized illustration with crisp linework and soft cel-shading blended with painterly, highly detailed backgrounds. Smooth gradients, subtle painterly brushwork for the sky and track textures, and delicate rim lighting on edges.

Lighting & optics: natural daylight with warm late-afternoon tones, subtle bloom, shallow depth of field (strong bokeh on foreground elements in the top shot), and realistic surface textures (fabric weave inside the circular rim, rubber/leather textures on the shoe sole).

Color palette: predominantly sky-blue and white for clothing/foreground highlights, warm golden sunlight, red track lanes, and green field background. Keep saturation vivid but balanced.

Narrative continuity: visually connect the two windows as sequential moments of the same scene — the top frame captures the moment the character stepped/raised their foot over the camera (or shoe interior), while the lower frame shows the immediate aftermath: the character sitting on the track taking off/inspecting the shoe. Make the two panels read as one short story beat.

---

# Screenshot Logic (what's actually happening)

Top window — POV shot inside the shoe: This is the moment the story/player chooses the action to put the shoe on. The image is from inside the shoe, showing the approaching paw and the shoe's inner fabric rim. A dialogue box with a highlighted choice sits at the bottom — that choice represents the player/character selecting to wear the shoe (or a similar action). The dirty sole/pads visible here will correspond to the shoe seen later.

Lower window — immediate aftermath / consequence: The scene has advanced to the character sitting on the track with the shoe now on (or recently adjusted). The character is examining the shoe/foot with a surprised/confused expression; the same shoe (with matching dirt patterns) appears in the foreground, confirming continuity between the two panels.

---

# ADDITIONAL NOTES

Include small, realistic OS window details (title bar, thin border, and subtle shadow).

Keep the composition crisp and cinematic, with the extreme close-up wide-angle top shot contrasting the calmer mid-shot below, and ensure both dialogue boxes contain Chinese text and the same chibi portrait to make the two images clearly part of the same visual novel interface.
```
